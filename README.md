A Responsive Card layout solution, implemented in pure CSS and HTML without JavaScript and yields the following functionality:
<br/><br/>
- Implementation of gradient background and card styles
- Provides a card hover over effect, increasing the card size, while applying a gaussian blur effect to the unselected cards
- Supports functionality to return all card states to default styles when navigating away from the selected card
